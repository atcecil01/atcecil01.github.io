This repo is intended to be a place to practice front-end web development, and show off the projects I have built.

The responsive page requirement was met for converting the 2 column layout to a single column layout on the main page.

More than 3 CSS rules were also written to meet the CSS requirement. Comments were also added.

Custom written JavaScript was written to toggle the navigation menu, and a lightweight vanilla image slider was added (replacing jQuery). Image optimization scripts and responsive srcset support were added, along with a hero/banner, subtle animations, and dark-mode support.
